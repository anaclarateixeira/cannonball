Changes to the cannonball package


2019 - October:

* The number of diagnostic plots in a parade defaults to 20 but can now be changed by the user ('size' parameter in the parade() function).

* In addition to plotting the residuals or absolute residuals against their respective fitted values, they can now also be plotted against their predictor values ('predictor' parameter in the lin_plot() and var_plot() functions).

* The parade() function now offers some support for transformed predictors (e.g., lm(y ~ I(x^2)). The use of poly() and ns() is still not supported, though, as broom::augment() doesn't support this either. See the examples on ?parade.

* parade_summary() now randomly maps the cells in the design to cell numbers.

* clustered_data() now supports measurement error and the generation of a covariate.

* New functions: walkthrough_p() and walkthrough_blocking(). See their help pages for more information.
